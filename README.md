You already know what this is.
If you don't, it's not for you.

### The Problem

Information asymmetry is a lie we tell ourselves.

Everyone has access. No one has leverage.

The delta between knowing and deciding is where fortunes evaporate.

---

### What Happens Here

```
input  → noise
output → signal → decision → irreversible action
```

We don't summarize. We don't aggregate. We don't make you feel informed.

We make the cost of *not* deciding visible.

### Access

Not open. Not yet.

If you understand the cost of delayed decisions, you'll find a way.

The best time to decide was yesterday.
The second best time is before you forget why it mattered.
